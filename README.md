# Traffic Detection using YOLO

A web-based visualization project for traffic detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection.  

## Overview

This project demonstrates traffic detection and analysis using YOLO object detection, with interactive visualizations built using D3.js. The system processes video footage and displays real-time detection results alongside analytical charts.
The project was forked from original YOLO detection and converted to fit for GT final project 2025 for Kiheon

## Visualizations

1. **Object Detection Overlay**
   - Real-time bounding box visualization
   - Color-coded by vehicle class
   - Shows confidence scores and tracking IDs

2. **Vehicle Count by Class**
   - Bar chart showing detected vehicle counts
   - Categorized by vehicle type
   - Allows for analysis of class distribution

3. **Total Vehicle Count**
   - Line chart showing total vehicles by frame
   - Provides analysis of traffic flow

## Technologies Used

- HTML & CSS for webpage and styling
- D3.js for data visualization
- YOLO v11 for object detection
- ByteTrack for object association
